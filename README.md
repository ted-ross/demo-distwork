# Application Interconnect Multi-Site Load Balancing Demonstration
## Overview
This project demonstrates how Red Hat Application Interconnect (RHAI) can be used to integrate databases and client applications with globally distributed services. The demonstration highlights some important characteristics of RHAI such as:
1. Integration of VM or bare metal-hosted databases with Kubernetes-based applications.
2. Simplified multi-site application integration.
3. Geolocation hosting flexibility
4. Global cost-based routing

Note: Red Hat Application INterconnect is based on the updstream opensource project "Skupper."
